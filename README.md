# HTMdesigner - My Personal Web Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website with an Ubuntu 20.04 theme, created by me using Next.js & Tailwind CSS.
The site showcases my work and skills through an interactive Ubuntu-like interface.

To run this on localhost
type `npm start` and when u are done coding type `npm run build` to build your app.

_NOTE: if you have yarn just replace `npm start` and `npm run build` with `yarn start` and `yarn build`._



### To make the contact form work

- Create a account in [emailjs](https://www.emailjs.com/) create also new Outlook or Gmail account to be able
  to send email.
- Create a new service, select and log in to your newly created outlook or gmail account on EmailJS.
- Go back to the dashboard and get the Service ID copy it.

into it. Replace \*your user id and your service ID with your values in your EmailJS service.

## About This Project

## This project was made using Create Next App! Here is the scripts that u can run.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
